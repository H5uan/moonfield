# Moonfield
A modern graphics rendering engine written in Rust, serving as an exploration ground for advanced graphics programming techniques and high-performance rendering systems. 

ðŸš§ **Status**: Active development - Everything is under construction. And this is just a playground for myself.

## âœ¨ Planned Features

- **Data-Oriented Design**: Find a good way to combine scene graph and ECS design since OOP design lacks a lot of flexibility in Rust.
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Primarily Metal and Vulkan backends.
- **Modern Graphics Pipeline**: GPU-driven pipeline, bindless rendering, mesh shading, variable rate shading etc.
- **Advanced Rendering**: Real-time ray tracing, real-time global illumination and ML-based techniques setc.

## ðŸ’» Hardware Environment

This is a personal project optimized for my development setup:
- **Primary GPU**: Apple M4, AMD RX 9070XT
- **Graphics Backend**: Metal (Current focus), Vulkan

Portability is not a priority.
