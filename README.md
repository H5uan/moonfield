# Moonfield

A modern graphics engine written in Rust, serving as an exploration ground for advanced graphics programming techniques and high-performance graphics systems.

ðŸš§ **Status**: Active development - Everything is under construction. And this is just a playground for myself.

## âœ¨ Planned Features

- **Data-Oriented Design**: Find a good way to combine scene graph and ECS design since OOP design lacks a lot of flexibility in Rust.
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Primarily Metal and Vulkan backends.
- **Modern Graphics Pipeline**: GPU-driven pipeline, bindless rendering, mesh shading, variable rate shading etc.
- **Advanced Rendering**: Real-time ray tracing, real-time global illumination, real-time appearance model, ML-based techniques etc.
- **Realtime Physics-based Animation**: XPBD, VBD etc.

## ðŸ’» Hardware Environment

This personal project is optimized for my primary development hardware:

### Primary Development Hardware
- **Apple Silicon**: M4 Mac (Primary development machine)
- **Windows Desktop**: AMD RX 9070XT GPU

### Supported Graphics APIs
- **Metal**: Primary focus and development backend
- **Vulkan**: Secondary backend support

### Target Platforms
- **macOS Sequoia 15.6.1**: Primary target platform
- **Windows 11 24H2**: Native support
- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**: Via WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

> **Note**: Portability across different hardware configurations is not a priority for this project.
